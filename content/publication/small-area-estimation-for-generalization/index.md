  Policymakers have grown increasingly interested in how experimental results

  may generalize to a larger population. However, recently developed propensity

  scoreâ€“based methods are limited by small sample sizes, where the experimental

  study is generalized to a population that is at least 20 times larger. This is

  particularly problematic for methods such as subclassification by propensity

  score, where limited sample sizes lead to sparse strata. This article explores the

  potential of small area estimation methods to improve the precision of estimators

  in sparse strata using population data as a source of auxiliary information

  to borrow strength. Results from simulation studies identify the

  conditions under which small area estimators outperform conventional estimators

  and the limitations of this application to causal generalization studies.
