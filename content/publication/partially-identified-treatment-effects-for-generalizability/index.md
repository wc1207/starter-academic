  Recent methods to improve generalizations from nonrandom samples
  typically invoke assumptions such as the strong ignorability of sample
  selection, which is challenging to meet in practice. Although
  researchers acknowledge the difficulty in meeting this assumption,
  point estimates are still provided and used without considering
  alternative assumptions. We compare the point identifying assumption
  of strong ignorability of sample selection with two alternative
  assumptions—bounded sample variation and monotone treatment
  response—that partially identify the parameter of interest, yielding
  interval estimates. Additionally, we explore the role that population
  data frames play in contributing identifying power for the interval
  estimates. We situate the comparison around causal generalization
  with nonrandom samples by applying the assumptions to a cluster
  randomized trial in education. Bounds on the population average
  treatment effect are derived under the alternative assumptions and
  the case when no assumptions are made on the data. While
  comparing the bounds, we discuss the plausibility of each alternative
  assumption and the practical trade-offs. We highlight the importance
  of thoughtfully considering the role that assumptions play in causal
  generalization by illustrating the differences in inferences from
  different assumptions.
