  Many experimental designs in educational and behavioral research involve

  at least one level of clustering. Clustering affects the precision of estimators

  and its impact on statistics in cross-sectional studies is well known.

  Clustering also occurs in longitudinal designs where students that are initially

  grouped may be regrouped in the following year and regrouped

  again in subsequent years. The purpose of this article is to explore the

  clustering effects of multiple waves of grouping on the effect sizes of

  downstream outcomes; that is, outcomes that are measured after one or

  more waves of regrouping. We center our framework on the longitudinal

  cluster randomized trial in which treatments are initially assigned by clusters

  (such as classrooms) and students are then regrouped into different

  clusters in subsequent years. This article illustrates how information on the

  intraclass correlations in longitudinal studies can be used to correct for

  biases in the effect sizes and variances, and how it can also be used to

  adjust the significance test for the effects of longitudinal clustering. This

  article also provides the first empirical evidence of the magnitude of longitudinal

  clustering effects using data from a state longitudinal data system.
