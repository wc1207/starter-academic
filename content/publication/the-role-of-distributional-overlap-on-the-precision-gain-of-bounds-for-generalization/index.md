abstract: Over the past ten years, propensity score methods have made an
  important contribution to improving generalizations from studies that do not
  select samples randomly from a population of inference. However, these methods
  require assumptions and recent work has considered the role of bounding
  approaches that provide a range of treatment impact estimates that are
  consistent with the observable data. An important limitation to bound
  estimates is that they can be uninformatively wide. This has motivated
  research on the use of propensity score stratification to narrow bounds. This
  article assesses the role of distributional overlap in propensity scores on
  the effectiveness of stratification to tighten bounds. Using the results of
  two simulation studies and two case studies, we evaluate the relationship
  between distributional overlap and precision gain and discuss the implications
  when propensity score stratification is used as a method to improve precision
  in the bounding framework.
