abstract: "Statisticians have developed propensity score methods to improve
  generalizations from studies that do not employ random sampling. However,
  these methods rely on assumptions whose plausibility may be questionable. We
  introduce and discuss bounding, an approach that is based on alternative
  assumptions that may be more plausible. The bounding framework
  nonparametrically estimates population parameters using a range of plausible
  values. We illustrate how to tighten bounds using three approaches: imposing a
  monotonicity assumption, redefining the population of inference, and using
  propensity score stratification. Using two simulation studies, we examine the
  conditions under which bounds are tightened. We conclude with an application
  of bounding to SimCalc, a cluster randomized trial that evaluated the
  effectiveness of a technology aid on mathematics achievement."
