abstract: Findings from experimental studies have increasingly been used to
  inform policy in school settings. Thus far, the populations in many of these
  studies are typically defined in a cross-sectional context; namely, the
  populations are defined in the same academic year in which the study took
  place or the population is defined at a fixed time point. This study assesses
  the extent to which the composition (observable characteristics) of a
  population changes over time and the implications of these changes for
  generalization and study design. We center our discussion around two case
  studies, both of which were cluster randomized trials in education. For each
  study, we collected multiple years of population level data and analyzed the
  types of changes that occurred in each study population over the given time
  period. Overall, we find that the most consistent changes are associated with
  the racial and demographic composition of the student populations. We discuss
  the implications of these changes and how they affect the types of populations
  for whom the findings of a study will be relevant.
