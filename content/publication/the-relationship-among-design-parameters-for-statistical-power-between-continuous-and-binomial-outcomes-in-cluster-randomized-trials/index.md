abstract: While research on statistical power for designs with continuous
  outcomes is extensive, the literature on power for designs with binary
  outcomes is notably more limited. Because statistical power for continuous
  outcomes is well known, a natural question is whether power may be estimated
  in a similar way for the case of binary outcomes. This question involves
  establishing the appropriate analogy between design parameters in the
  continuous and binary outcome cases, which consists of an analogy in effect
  sizes and an analogy in the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). This
  article proposes two possible analogies for the ICC and discusses the
  challenges in establishing a valid and useful analogy for statistical power in
  designs with binary outcomes. Using the results from two simulation studies,
  we compare the power estimates and Type I error rates under two analytic
  models for binary outcomes and the corresponding values under the ICC
  analogies. We use the simulation results to assess the implications for power
  and statistical inference when no useful analogy in ICCs exists for a given
  study. We provide a discussion on how researchers might think of the analogies
  using an empirical example on a preschool intervention in Ghana. We conclude
  with final thoughts on the limitations in establishing an analogy in design
  parameters and ideas for future research.
