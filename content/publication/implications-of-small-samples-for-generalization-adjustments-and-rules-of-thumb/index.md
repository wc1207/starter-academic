  Policy makers and researchers are frequently interested in

  understanding how effective a particular intervention may be for a specific

  population. One approach is to assess the degree of similarity between the

  sample in an experiment and the population. Another approach is to combine

  information from the experiment and the population to estimate the

  population average treatment effect (PATE). Method: Several methods for

  assessing the similarity between a sample and population currently exist as

  well as methods estimating the PATE. In this article, we investigate properties

  of six of these methods and statistics in the small sample sizes common in education research (i.e., 10â€“70 sites), evaluating the utility of

  rules of thumb developed from observational studies in the generalization

  case. Result: In small random samples, large differences between the sample

  and population can arise simply by chance and many of the statistics

  commonly used in generalization are a function of both sample size and the

  number of covariates being compared. The rules of thumb developed in

  observational studies (which are commonly applied in generalization) are

  much too conservative given the small sample sizes found in generalization.

  Conclusion: This article implies that sharp inferences to large populations

  from small experiments are difficult even with probability sampling. Features

  of random samples should be kept in mind when evaluating the extent

  to which results from experiments conducted on nonrandom samples

  might generalize.
